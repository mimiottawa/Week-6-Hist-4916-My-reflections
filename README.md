My reflections

It is interesting to see how technology is transforming communication patterns among museums and their visitors; the communication road is no longer one way only.
Anyone can disseminate information over the internet about a museum or a collection. 
Visitors can also talk about their personal experiences when visiting museums. 
We have seen how such institutions exercise their presence over the web and also over social media. The internet allows museums to interact with their audiences in a very dynamic manner.  
So many museums have joined Facebook and have ‘conquered’ millions of ‘friends’ who follow them and leave comments.  
This communication reciprocity allows visitors to affect the way museums address their audiences. 
Now…
How can museums control public comments?
How can they keep their online reputation?
How can they manage negative comments?

Some comments can be really hard to orchestrate.
For instance, if you go to the ‘trip advisor website’, you can find really negative comments/reviews about the Museum of Nature here in Ottawa.
Please see below a complaint from a visitor and the museum’s response.

“Worst experience!
So I brought my 2 adult daughters to see the reptile exhibit (my older one loves reptiles and has one herself) Biggest disappointment. Hardly any reptiles, no one giving information about them, and if you are going to advertise about reptiles, you should have something very unique (most were just snakes) You are better off going to Little Ray's, and I am being honest.

Secondly the volunteer's are VERY rude. My Daughter's sat down to look at the leaf table (no one was there) they were genuinely interested and started to design some leaves on the paper provided. A volunteer named "Christianne" came over and said "this is for children" and gave them the dirtiest look and kept hovering over them rudely. My older Daughter stood up, she grabbed her paper with leaves on it, and crumpled it up in front of her. Some children came to the table finally, they wanted to colour, but she grabbed the leaves from my younger Daughter and told them they were to play with the leaves.

We paid over $65 for admission for 3 people, (plus 12 for parking!) and after that promptly left. Was not worth even close to that.

you would think a Museum would want people to learn and explore, this is not the case here. the volunteer's/staff were neither helpful or polite.

I really hope they read this and take action. your volunteer made my Daughter's feel awful and in turn I felt horrible for even bringing them as no one deserves to be treated like that. We will not be returning and take our complaint higher. If you do not want young adults to learn or participate you should make that clear before you charge us for admission!”

“Thank you for your comments. As a national museum and major attraction in the National Capital Region, we want to ensure the best possible experience for our visitors. Feedback such as yours is very, very important.    We’re sorry that you were disappointed with our current Reptiles exhibition. It is a travelling, educational exhibition from an accredited zoo in the United States and has been received quite well by our visitors. It’s unfortunate that it didn’t meet your expectations.   We deeply apologize for the experience you had at the hands-on botany station. The intention there is to have the plant-mounting activity for adults and a paper leaf craft for children. We’re very sorry that your daughters had a negative experience with a volunteer at that station. We are looking into the situation and will re-examine our current volunteer training. A positive museum experience for visitors of all ages is our utmost priority. Thank you so much for drawing this to our attention.    We hope you will visit us again. On June 21, we are opening our new Arctic Gallery (included in museum admission) which will offer genuine specimens, artifacts, multimedia and unique perspectives on this vast, mysterious and little-understood region.   Again, thank you, and please accept our apologies.”

My reflections

When I think about non-Western models of museum curations, the work of Sandra Benites comes to mind.
She is the very first Brazilian Indigenous curator, from the Guarani people. She is working for the MASP Museum in Sao Paulo. Her goal is to bring not only the Indigenous works of art into museums, but also their voices. Specially considering how Brazilian history and geography books usually do not include the Indigenous voices in their texts. She mentions how the Indigenous people of Brazil is simply ‘not afraid anymore’. Sandra is working hard so the narratives and world vision of the Indigenous people can be heard. Therefore, she is organizing an exhibition with sculptures, paintings, photographs, dance and song performances from Brazilian natives. She mentions how this exhibition is also the concretization of the Indigenous people’s cry. They cry for the deforestation of the Amazon, they cry for the way how mining and hydroelectric stations are destroying their land. She hopes that through art demonstrations, they can have their voices heard, thus a dialogue can be initialized. She also mentions the importance of including the work of Indigenous women into this exhibition.

Sharing Authority: Creating Content and Experiences 
My reflections 
Collaboration, Contribution and Co-creation
When I think about the issue of sharing authority within the museum environment, I think about the sharing of authority even among curators themselves. Apparently, there is a ‘camouflaged struggle’ among prestigious academic curators and self-taught curators. Last week, I was able to watch a great movie on Netflix called ‘The Dig’. Please see the YouTube link below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZQz0rkNajo
It portraits a landowner called Edith Pretty who hires a local self-taught archaeologist-excavator named Basil Brown to tackle the large burial mounds at her rural estate in Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge). 
However, the news of the discovery soon spreads, and Cambridge archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives. He declares the site to be of national importance, and takes over the dig by order of the Office of Works.
Brown's contributions to archaeology were recognised ONLY in 2009 by a plaque in Rickinghall Inferior Church.
